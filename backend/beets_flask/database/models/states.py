"""Minimal state model for the beets_flask application.

Allows to resume a import at any time using our state dataclasses,
see importer/state.py for more information.

Why not just have State and StateInDb in the same class?
- ORM ideally wants full mirroring of whats in RAM in the DB. This is hard to ensure
  in our case, as we dont have full control over beets tasks etc.
- A lot of beets objects do not neatly translate to DB objects.
- Often we want states without having to think about a DB Session.
- Just a current motivation and choice, will revisit this later.
