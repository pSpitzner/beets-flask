# Especially the `folders` section in the `inbox` section are important to set up your inbox
# folders. You can add as many folders as you like, but don't forget to volume-map them in
# your docker-compose.yml.

                #                 useful for bootlegs, where you manually clean metadata

                # "auto": fetch data and import if a good match is found (recommended for established libraries,
                #         but not for a big initial import when you start with beets for the first time)
