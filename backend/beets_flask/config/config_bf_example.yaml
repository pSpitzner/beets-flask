# Feel free to edit this file to customize the gui configuration.
# Especially the `folders` section in the `inbox` section are important to set up your inbox
# folders. You can add as many folders as you like, but don't forget to volume-map them in
# your docker-compose.yml.

            # Before using the inbox feature, you need to create the folders
            # and decide on an inbox type. Have a look at the examples below.

            Inbox1:
                name: "Dummy inbox"
                path: "/music/dummy"
                autotag: no
                # do not automatically trigger tagging and do not automatically import
            Inbox2:
                name: "Auto Inbox"
                path: "/music/inbox_auto"
                autotag: "auto"
                # trigger tag and import if a good match is found based on `auto_threshold`
                auto_threshold: null
                # if set to null, uses the value in beets config (match.strong_rec_thresh)
                # define the distance from a perfect match, i.e. set to 0.1 to import
                # matches with 90% similarity or better.
            Inbox3:
                name: "An Inbox that only generates the previews"
                path: "/music/inbox_preview"
                autotag: "preview"
                # trigger tag but do not import, recommended for most control
