## Motivation

<!-- start motivation -->

Autotagging music with beets is great. Beets identifies metadata correctly _most_ of the time, and if you are not a control-freak, there is hardly any reason to check the found metadata.

However, if you do want a bit more control, things could be more convenient.

This is the main idea with beets-flask: For all folders in your inbox, we generate a preview of what beets _would do_ and show you those previews. Then it's easy to go through them and import the correct ones, while falling back to terminal for those that were not to your liking.

<!-- end motivation -->

## Quickstart

We provide a docker image with the full beeets-flask setup. You can run it with docker-compose or docker. We recommend using the `stable` tag, alternatively you may use `latest` for the most recent build.

### Setup container

**Using docker**

```sh
docker run -d -p 5001:5001 \
    -e USER_ID=1000 \
    -e GROUP_ID=1000 \
    -v /wherever/config/:/config \
    -v /music_path/inbox/:/music_path/inbox/ \
    -v /music_path/clean/:/music_path/clean/ \
    --name beets-flask \
    pspitzner/beets-flask:stable
```

**Using docker compose**

```yaml
services:
    beets-flask:
        image: pspitzner/beets-flask:stable
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
            - "5001:5001"
        environment:
            # 502 is default on macos, 1000 on linux
            USER_ID: 1000
            GROUP_ID: 1000
        volumes:
            - /wherever/config/:/config
            # for music folders, match paths inside and out of container!
            - /music_path/inbox/:/music_path/inbox/
            - /music_path/clean/:/music_path/clean/
```

This will create a container with the following folder structure:

```
├── music_path
│   ├── inbox
│   └── clean
└── config
    ├── beets
    │   ├── config.yaml
    │   └── library.db
    └── beets-flask
        ├── config.yaml
        └── beets-flask-sqlite.db
```
