/**
 * Custom hook that calculates the difference between two strings using the `diff` library.
 * Supports multiple comparison methods with automatic fallback heuristics.
 *
 * @param {string | null} from - The original string (default: "")
 * @param {string | null} to - The modified string (default: "")
 * @param {"chars" | "words" | "wordsWithSpace" | "full" | "auto"} method - Comparison method:
 *    - "chars": Character-level diff
 *    - "words": Word-level diff (ignores whitespace)
 *    - "wordsWithSpace": Word-level diff (preserves whitespace)
 *    - "full": Returns full before/after strings as changes
 *    - "auto": Automatically chooses between char/word diff (default)
 * @returns {Change[]} Array of change objects containing:
 *    - value: The substring content
 *    - count: Length of the substring
 *    - added/removed: Change type flags (when applicable)
 * @example
 * const changes = useDiff("Hello world", "Hello there");
 * // Returns diff segments showing removed "world" and added "there"
 * @note Uses memoization to prevent unnecessary recalculations
 * @see https://www.npmjs.com/package/diff for underlying library documentation
