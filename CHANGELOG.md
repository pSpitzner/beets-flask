All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),

## [0.1.0] - 24-11-13

### Fixed

-  Renamed `kind` to `type` in search frontend code to be consistent with backend.
   Using kind for tags (preview, import, auto), and types for search (album, track).

### Changed


-  Improved readme and onboarding experience
-  Mountpoint to persist config files and databases changed to `/config` (was `/home/beetle/.config/beets/`)
   We create the `/config/beets` and `/config/beets-flask` folders on startup if they do not exist.
   Library files are placed there, and you can drop a `config.yaml` either or both of these folders. Settings in `/config/beets-flask/config.yaml` take precedence over `/config/beets/config.yaml`.
   **You will need to update your docker-compose!**

### Added

-  Logo and favicon
-  Image now on docker hub: `pspitzner/beets-flask:stable`
-  Auto-import: automatically import folders that are added to the inbox if the match is good enough.
   After a preview, import will start if the match quality is above the configured.
   Enable via the config.yaml, set the `autotag` field of a configred inbox folders to `"auto"`.

## [0.0.4] - 24-10-04

### Fixed

### Added

-   multi-disc albums are now supported
-   Interactive import using a custom beets pipeline

### Changed

-   Moved terminal to its own page, had to temporarily remove keyboard trigger
-   Reworked the album folder detection algorithm, now uses more native beets code and is a bit faster
-   Navbar styling and items overhaul

## [0.0.3] - 24-08-01

### Fixed

-   default config: mandatory fields cannot be set in the yaml, or they
    might persist although the user sets them. moved to config loading in python.
-   tmux session now restarts on page load if it is not alive.
-   navbar, tags, inbox are now more friendly for mobile
-   folder paths are now better escaped for terminal imports

### Added

-   Backend to get cover art from metadata of music files.
-   Impoved library view (mobile friendly, and a browser header component)
-   Library search

### Changed

-   Simplified folder structure of frontend
-   Removed `include_paths` option from config and library backend (most of the frontend needs some form of file paths. thus, the option was not / could not be respected consistently)

## [0.0.2] - 24-07-16
